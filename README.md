1. 1.This project is an interactive fashion show experience that allows the user 
2. to insert themselves and show their own style. It isn't constrained to other people's taste like other projects and can always change easily.
3. 2.By using multiple divs and empty img tags we were able to connect multiple images and different pieces together to make a functional project. The clothes and human in it are entirely made from scratch.
4. 3. The project definitely suffered from a lack of time and experience in creating some of the things planned. We planned to create a muiltiplayer mode were you can compete with other people and the audience can vote for the person with the best fashion choice.
5. But we couldn't due to the lack of time and time management.
6. 4. We all learned new ways to use canvas (as difficult as it was). We didn't know how to implement canvas to take live photos.
